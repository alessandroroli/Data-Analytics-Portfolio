**Project Overview: TheLook E-commerce Data Analysis**  
In this project, I worked with a team of 5 individuals, and together, we embarked on a comprehensive data exploration journey. We leveraged a diverse array of tools and methodologies to uncover meaningful insights from e-commerce data. Here's a high-level summary of the steps we took:


- **Data Retrieval from BigQuery**  
We initiated the project by extracting valuable the look e-commerce data using SQL queries in BigQuery.
Queries were tailored to gather data relevant to our specific analysis topics.

- **Data Transformation and Table Creation**  
After obtaining raw data, we structured tables based on our analysis topics.
This step organized data for easier manipulation and exploration.

- **Data Cleaning with Python**  
Data quality and accuracy were ensured through Python data cleaning.
Tasks included handling missing values, addressing outliers, and standardizing formats.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis with Python**  
Cleaned data enabled an initial exploratory analysis.
We used statistical and graphical methods to reveal patterns, trends, and insights.

- **Visualization and Storytelling with Tableau**  
We continued with a more in-depth analysis on Tableau.
Engaging visuals were created to effectively communicate our findings.
These visuals were integrated into a cohesive narrative using Tableau's "story" feature.

- **Presentation to the Class**  
Our analysis and insights were presented to classmates.
Tableau's "story" feature facilitated an engaging and accessible presentation.

**Project Overview: Analysis of a Software Professionals Dataset and an Indian Startups Fundings Dataset with Python**

- Part 1: In the first analysis, I worked with a dataset on Kaggle containing information about over 20,000 software professionals. I used Python to conduct an analysis and extract various insights.

- Part 2: In the second analysis, I worked with a dataset on Kaggle containing information about funding for Indian startups in the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. I began with an initial analysis using Python and then connected it with the dataset from Part 1 for a more in-depth analysis.

$${\color{blue}PROJECT-3}$$

For this project, I worked with a partially cleaned dataset, which I organized in Tableau, and then focused on visually representing some insights.
The dataset pertains to The European Social Survey (ESS), which is a large-scale survey of social attitudes and issues among people living in Europe.
This dataset is from the 2016/17 round of the survey and includes over 500 variables, surveying more than 40,000 people.

$${\color{blue}PROJECT-4}$$ 

In this project, I worked with a dataset available on Tableau: 'World Indicators,' and I created a dashboard to communicate how the global financial crisis has impacted the world from the perspective of GDP, using a journalistic approach.

**Project Overview: European Soccer Database Analysis**

This project involves working with the European Soccer Database, which consists of four CSV files:
- leagues.csv
- match.csv
- player.csv
- team.csv

The goal is to perform various data analysis tasks using SQL, providing insights into different aspects of European soccer leagues, teams, and players.

**Data Preparation**  
- **Dataset Creation:** A new dataset about European Soccer Database was created in Google BigQuery, and each CSV file was loaded as a separate table.  
- **Schema Design:** Using Lucidchart, a schema representing the relationship between all tables was created. This included designating primary and foreign keys and illustrating table connections.

**Analysis Tasks**  
- **Dataset Time Interval:** Calculated the number of days between the oldest and most recent match.  
- **Home Goals Analysis:** Produced statistics (min, average, mid-range, max, sum) for home goals scored per Season and League.  
- **Season and League Analysis:** Determined the number of unique seasons and analyzed matches played by each league per season.  
- **BMI Analysis:** Created a PlayerBMI table, analyzed players' BMI, and filtered for optimal BMI values.  
- **Team Performance Analysis:** Identified teams with the highest total number of goals in recent seasons and across different seasons.
