PROJECT #1

**Project Overview: E-commerce Data Exploration**

In this project, we embarked on a comprehensive journey of data exploration, leveraging a diverse array of tools and methodologies to unearth meaningful insights from e-commerce data. Here's a high-level summary of the steps we undertook:

**Data Retrieval from BigQuery:**
We initiated the project by extracting valuable the look e-commerce data using SQL queries in BigQuery.
Queries were tailored to gather data relevant to our specific analysis topics.

**Data Transformation and Table Creation:**
After obtaining raw data, we structured tables based on our analysis topics.
This step organized data for easier manipulation and exploration.

**Data Cleaning with Python:**
Data quality and accuracy were ensured through Python data cleaning.
Tasks included handling missing values, addressing outliers, and standardizing formats.

**Exploratory Data Analysis with Python:**
Cleaned data enabled an initial exploratory analysis.
We used statistical and graphical methods to reveal patterns, trends, and insights.

**Visualization and Storytelling with Tableau:**
We continued with a more in-depth analysis on Tableau.
Engaging visuals were created to effectively communicate our findings.
These visuals were integrated into a cohesive narrative using Tableau's "story" feature.

**Presentation to the Class:**
Our analysis and insights were presented to classmates.
Tableau's "story" feature facilitated an engaging and accessible presentation.
