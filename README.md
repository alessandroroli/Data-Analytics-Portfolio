# Portfolio Data Analysis

***PROJECT #1***

**Project Overview: TheLook E-commerce Data Analysis**  
In this project, I worked with a team of 5 individuals, and together, we embarked on a comprehensive data exploration journey. We leveraged a diverse array of tools and methodologies to uncover meaningful insights from e-commerce data. Here's a high-level summary of the steps we took:

**Data Retrieval from BigQuery:**  
We initiated the project by extracting valuable the look e-commerce data using SQL queries in BigQuery.
Queries were tailored to gather data relevant to our specific analysis topics.

**Data Transformation and Table Creation:**  
After obtaining raw data, we structured tables based on our analysis topics.
This step organized data for easier manipulation and exploration.

**Data Cleaning with Python:**  
Data quality and accuracy were ensured through Python data cleaning.
Tasks included handling missing values, addressing outliers, and standardizing formats.

**Exploratory Data Analysis with Python:**  
Cleaned data enabled an initial exploratory analysis.
We used statistical and graphical methods to reveal patterns, trends, and insights.

**Visualization and Storytelling with Tableau:**  
We continued with a more in-depth analysis on Tableau.
Engaging visuals were created to effectively communicate our findings.
These visuals were integrated into a cohesive narrative using Tableau's "story" feature.

**Presentation to the Class:**  
Our analysis and insights were presented to classmates.
Tableau's "story" feature facilitated an engaging and accessible presentation.

***PROJECT #2***

**Project Overview: Analysis of a Software Professionals Dataset and an Indian Startups Fundings Dataset with Python**

Part 1: In the first analysis, I worked with a dataset on Kaggle containing information about over 20,000 software professionals. I used Python to conduct an analysis and extract various insights.

Part 2: In the second analysis, I worked with a dataset on Kaggle containing information about funding for Indian startups in the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. I began with an initial analysis using Python and then connected it with the dataset from Part 1 for a more in-depth analysis.

You can see more information in the project folder.

***PROJECT #3*** 
For this project, I worked with a partially cleaned dataset, which I organized in Tableau, and then focused on visually representing some insights.
The dataset pertains to The European Social Survey (ESS), which is a large-scale survey of social attitudes and issues among people living in Europe.
This dataset is from the 2016/17 round of the survey and includes over 500 variables, surveying more than 40,000 people.
